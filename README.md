# Flight-search

With this app, you can look for the cheapest flights from any source to any destination (using IATA code of the city you want to travel from/to). Using several free APIs, this app looks for the cheapest flights for the trip you want in a given timespan that is specified in the app (the next 6 months, you can adjust this to your preference). The length of the trip is by default 7 days (also adjustable).
Finally, this app sends you a message on Telegram (if you give it your Telegram ID) with a link to the cheapest flights found.
